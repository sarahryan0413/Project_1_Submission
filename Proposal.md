## Project Description/Outline

Since the 2020 pandemic, Tiktok has had a profound impact on the online creative community, especially musical artists. With users being able to integrate clips of music into their own online content, the exposure gained through short clipped content is notable. In parallel, older streaming platforms for music such as YouTube and Spotify are still utilized to curate playlists for longer-term and personalized consumption. This research aims to determine if Tiktok can predict the most popular music trending in 2024 for Spotify and Youtube. (Is the relationship correlational or causational? How strong is the relationship?) The data explored will focus on Tiktok’s impact on Spotify and Youtube data. 

## Research Questions to Answer: 

Main Research Questions

* How do playlists impact streaming?  
  * How much of an impact do editorial playlists like “Viral Songs” have on  prolonging a song’s popularity after TikTok virality?  
* How does social media impact streaming?  
* How does release date or time of year impact streaming?  
* What artist gained the most followers in 2024? Which are new versus established versus resurgence. Pre-tiktok versus post-tiktok.  
* Are TikTok viral songs more likely to perform better on Spotify, YouTube, or both?   
  * I’m not sure if this should be a main research question but thought I’d put it here to see what you all think  
* How long does it take for a viral TikTok song to peak on Spotify or YouTube (lag analysis)? What does the listener retention rates and playlist additions on Spotify look like in relation?

Genre-specific questions

* Are certain genres more likely to become viral on TikTok versus trending on Spotify?  
* How does TikTok virality impact the performance of niche genres versus mainstream genres?

Influence of TikTok Challenge and Trends

* Does the presence of a viral dance challenge significantly boost Spotify streams for a given song?  
* How do different TikTok trends (dance, meme, background music) affect streaming success on Spotify?

## Rough Breakdown of Tasks: 

1. Analyze the relationship between views: Sarah \[Spotify\] , Jameson \[YouTube\]  
   1. Establish the correlation between TikTok views and streaming metrics on Spotify and Youtube.  
   2. Tiktok is the control variable for the data with Spotify and Youtube being analyzed against Tiktok.   
2. Analyze the relationship between likes: Dina \[Spotify\], Patrick \[YouTube\], Quinton \[YouTube\]  
   1. Examine the correlation between TikTok likes and engagement on Spotify and Youtube.  
   2. Tiktok is the control variable for the data with Spotify and Youtube being analyzed against Tiktok.   
3. Identify common features of top-performing songs:  
   1. Are there shared characteristics (e.g. tempo, beat drops, lyrics) among most popular TikTok songs?  
   2. Conduct a similar analysis for top-ranked songs on Youtube and Spotify. This will be utilizing Spotify API.   
4. Draw a conclusion based on the data to determine whether or not Tiktok trends are a predictor of success on Youtube and Spotify.  
   1. Evaluate the strength and nature of the relationship (correlation vs. causation).   
      1. Look at listener retention rates and playlist additions on Spotify.
